# Tilted-Vortex-Lattice
Code used to calculate the structure of superconducting vortex lattices in tilted magnetic fields according to the expressions provided in https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.184502. The vortex lattice is sketched in both, vortex lattice and surface frames.
