# Tilted-Vortex-Lattice
A matlab Project where we simulate the effect of tilted magnetic fields on superconducting vortex lattices. 
For more information see: Subsurface bending and reorientation of tilted vortex lattices in the bulk due to Coulomb-like 
repulsion at the surface. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06493]
